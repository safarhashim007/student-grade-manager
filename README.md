# Student Grade Manager (Python)

A command-line Python application to manage student records, store subject-wise grades, and calculate average marks.  
This project focuses on strengthening Python fundamentals such as file handling, data parsing, and menu-driven program design.

## Features
- Add student records
- Add subject-wise grades for each student
- View all students
- Calculate average marks per student
- Data stored locally using text files

## How It Works
The application runs in the terminal and provides a simple menu-based interface.  
Student names are stored first, and grades can be added later for each student.  
All data is saved and updated using basic file operations.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python grade_manager.py
